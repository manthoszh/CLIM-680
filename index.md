### The Question:
The main scientific topic I want to explore is precipitation variability. Precipitation and other weather phenomena vary for many reasons which vary in scale from meters to tens of thousand of kilometers and from minutes to decades. Trying to understand the reasons why precipitation does what it does is a complex set of questions that if answered could have major societal benfits.

In much of the analyses completed I try to connect the dots, if any, between precipitation and the Mid-Latitude Seasonal Oscillation (MLSO). It is well documented that there are large scale teleconnections, like ENSO, that have can influence precipitation over large areas and timescales. The MSLO is akin to the larger teleconnections and oscillation, it is a mode of variability for the Northern Hemisphere. It has an average period of 120 days. The MLSO has phases that lineup closely with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Pacific North American pattern (PNA), both of which have been shown to cause precipitation variability across North America.

### The Datasets:
**GPCP Dataset:**

The GPCP dataset is a one degree by one degree daily dataset that covers the time span of 1996-10-01 to 2020-05-31. This dataset is derived from satelite data. The dataset has been shown to match up well with reanalyses and ground measurements for the daily precipitation values.
